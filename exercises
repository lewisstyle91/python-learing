#interest first exercise in functions that had me perplexed at first as i was trying to return just the list, until i found the str.join answer

def myfunc (string):
    list = []
    index = 0
    for char in string:
        if index %2 == 0:
            list.append(char.upper())
        else:
            list.append(char.lower())
        index=index+1
    return ''.join(list)
